# HITs_HelloStudents_Bot
This bot was created for discord server of Higher IT School TSU for greeting new students there.

## To start the bot
You need to download nodejs and create .env in directory near to bot.js and create files welcomeTextFor1stGradeServer and welcomeTextForFreeTimeServer here. But I think it would be better to refactor a name of the Hello message text and delete ternary operator at the end of the bot.js.

To run the bot with prepared script write this in the console 
  `nodejs bot.js`
